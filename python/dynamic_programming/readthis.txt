What are requirements for Dynamic Programming?

1) Optimal Substructure - if the optimal solution to the complete problem can be found with optimal solutions to
sub-problems with a recurrence relation
2) Overlapping sub-problems - if there is a need to solve the sub-problems multiple times to reach the optimal
overall solution
